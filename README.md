# Custom-Churn-Jupyter-Notebook

Using Logistic Regression predicted which customers from a telecommunications company were
likely to leave. Explored key indicators of customer churn (high bill pricing, online payment vs. mail, etc.)
and explored how True Positive, and False Positive rates attributed to the efficacy of our model.

The project can be viewed in the above notebook.
