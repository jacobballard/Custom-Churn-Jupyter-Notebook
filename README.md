# Custom-Churn-Jupyter-Notebook

Using Logistic Regression predicted which customers from a telecommunications company were
likely to leave. Explored key indicators of customer churn (high bill pricing, online payment vs. mail, etc.)
and explored how True Positive, and False Positive rates attributed to the efficacy of our model.

The project can be viewed in the above notebook (lab_03).

In a subsequent project we then explored the use of different classification models like
K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Decision Forests, and Support Vector Machines. These
were all compared along with the previous Logistic Regression model and the best model was
determined using the AUC score of each for True Positives vs. False Positives and based on that
Logistic Regression was still the best model.

This can also be viewed aboved (lab_04).
